# website-experience
This repository contains the steps I took to add a custom domain, and integrate GitHub to my static website.

Detailed steps taking in the completion of this project:

1 Create a GitHub Account

- I created a GitHub account at https://github.com/
- I studied the GitHub environment to understand basics like repositories, commits, and pushes.

2 Purchase Domain Name on AWS Route 53

- I purchased a professional domain name from AWS Route 53.

3 Modify URLs in My Website

- I replaced the placeholder links for LinkedIn, GitHub and Email with my personal account links.
- I addesd a new URL pointing to my resume.

4 Configure Domain Name for the Static Website

- I use my newly purchased domain name for my static website and set up Route 53 DNS records. 
The process was easy with the guidance of some AWS documentation online
